        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        	<p>We propose a novel self-supervised neural reconstruction method that can reconstruct and segment 3D objects at high-quality using localized multi-view images. By assuming objects usually sitting on one supporting plane, we represent a 3D scene as one major supporting plane with multiple objects on top, with each entity as a neural radiance field parameterized by a coordinate-based MLP. We jointly reconstruct the 3D objects, the planar structure, and the 3D decomposition via multi-pass differentiable neural radiance field rendering using only images as input. In contrast to the traditional semantic-based 3D object localization and reconstruction methods, our method is completely taxonomy free and can achieve accurate 3D segmentation for a wide variety of opaque objects. We demonstrate that our method can achieve high-quality view-consistent rendering and object segmentation for a wide range of objects in CO3D dataset without using any provided masks. Our method works equally well for objects which can not be detected and localized by semantic-based methods. With the accurate geometry, appearance modeling and decomposition, we can further enable 3D object discovery and scene editing applications.</p>
