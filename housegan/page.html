The main idea is to encode the constraint into the graph structure of its relational networks. We have demonstrated the proposed architecture for a new house layout generation problem, whose task is to take an architectural constraint as a graph (i.e., the number and types of rooms with their spatial adjacency) and produce a set of axis-aligned bounding boxes of rooms. We measure the quality of generated house layouts with the three metrics: the realism, the diversity, and the compatibility with the input graph constraint. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations over 117,000 real floorplan images demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and baselines. We will publicly share all our code and data.</p>      </div>	  <hr />	      </div>    <div class="content">      <div class="text">        <h3>Paper</h3>      </div>      <div class="img">		<img class="img_teaser" src="paper.jpg">      </div>      <div class="center_text">	     <span class="link"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06988">[Arxiv]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./housegan_suppl.pdf">[Supp.]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./bib.txt">[Bibtex]</a></span>	  </div>	  <hr />	</div>		<div class="content">		<div class="text">			<h3>Code/Data</h3>		</div>		<p>Check the code and data on this <a href="https://github.com/ennauata/housegan">repo</a>.</p>		<hr />	</div>		<div class="content bottom_block">		<div class="text">			<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>		</div>		<p>This research is partially supported by NSERC Discovery Grants, NSERC Discovery Grants Accelerator Supplements, and DND/NSERC Discovery Grant Supplement.
