We provide a new benchmark with ground-truth annotations for 2,001 complex buildings across the cities of Atlanta, Paris, and Las Vegas. We also propose a novel algorithm utilizing 1) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that detects geometric primitives and classifies their relationships and 2) an integer programming (IP) that assembles the information into a 2D planar graph. While being a trivial task for human vision, the inference of a graph structure with an arbitrary topology is still an open problem for computer vision. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm makes significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art, towards an intelligent system at the level of human perception. We will share code and data to promote further research. </p>      </div>	  <hr />	      </div>    <div class="content">      <div class="text">        <h3>Paper</h3>      </div>      <div class="img">		<img class="img_teaser" src="paper.jpg">      </div>      <div class="center_text">	     <span class="link"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05135">[Arxiv]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./buildings_suppl.pdf">[Supp.]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./bib.txt">[Bibtex]</a></span>	  </div>	  <hr />	</div>		<div class="content">		<div class="text">			<h3>Code/Data</h3>		</div>		<p>Check the code and data on this <a href="https://github.com/ennauata/buildings2vec">repo</a>.</p>		<hr />	</div>		<div class="content bottom_block">		<div class="text">			<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>		</div>		<p>This research is partially supported by NSERC Discovery Grants, NSERC Discovery Grants Accelerator Supplements, and DND/NSERC Discovery Grant 		Supplement.
