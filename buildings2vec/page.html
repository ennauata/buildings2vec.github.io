In our problem, nodes correspond to building edges in an image. 		Conv-MPN is different from MPN in that 1) the feature associated with a node is represented as a feature volume instead of a 1D vector; and 		2) convolutions encode messages instead of fully connected layers. Conv-MPN learns to select a true subset of nodes (i.e., building edges) to reconstruct a building planar graph. 		Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations over 2,000 buildings show that Conv-MPN makes significant improvements over the existing fully neural solutions. 		We believe that the paper has a potential to open a new line of graph neural network research for structured geometry reconstruction.</p>      </div>	  <hr />	      </div>    <div class="content">      <div class="text">        <h3>Paper</h3>      </div>      <div class="img">		<img class="img_teaser" src="paper.png">      </div>      <div class="center_text">	     <span class="link"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01756">[Arxiv]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./conv_mpn_supp.pdf">[Supp.]</a></span>	     <span class="link"><a href="./bib.txt">[Bibtex]</a></span>	  </div>	  <hr />	</div>		<div class="content">		<div class="text">			<h3>Code/Data</h3>		</div>		<p>Check the code on this <a href="https://github.com/zhangfuyang/Conv-MPN">repo</a>.</p>		<hr />	</div>		<div class="content bottom_block">		<div class="text">			<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>		</div>		<p>This research is partially supported by NSERC Discovery Grants, NSERC Discovery Grants Accelerator Supplements, and DND/NSERC Discovery Grant 		Supplement.
